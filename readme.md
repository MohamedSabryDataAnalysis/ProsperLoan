## Summary of Findings

> Summarize all of your findings from your exploration here, whether you plan on bringing them into your explanatory presentation or not.
> As the dataset contains a massive number of features (81) i only done exploration on some of the variables that i thout will be most intersting. I got to know some of the feautures better. I started with checking if the loan origination date can be of effect on the loan whether it was yearly, monthly or a certain day of the month, however there was no claer evedince for that. i check loan terms and found that by far the most papular term is 36 month and the least is 12 month.

>i've found also that most popular loan category is debt consolidation. After doing some research I found that this is one of the best uses of prosper loans .

[The below is quoted from here](https://www.moneyunder30.com/)

> “The best use of Prosper may be debt consolidation loans. If you have high credit card balances on one or more cards, you may be able to consolidate with a lower interest rate at Prosper. If your rate is below what you pay on your cards, you should save money and may even be able to pay off your loan faster.”

> When I explored the duration of employment I found that people with less employment duration take more loans. Maybe this because usually the financial struggles more among youth or maybe due to some wisdom gained by experience that advice against taking loans. Or maybe simply as you gain more experience your salary increases and you don’t need to get loans. Also found that with more emplyment duration the loans amounts get higher. That was supported also when i checked for APR VS. debt to income ratio and found that the less your debt to income ratio the lower you will get an APR.

> I found also that one of the most factors that affect APR is the borrower rating. I tried to get deeper and and foudn that APR is affected by the monthly income and whether or not it is verifiable.

> Also found a relation between owning a  home and getting a lower APR
